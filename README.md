# D3-Typescript-Playground

A bare-bones skeleton repo for experimenting with the D3 library, assisted via the power of Typescript type definitions and Snowpack.

## Installation

Assuming you have node installed, you can just run

```console
npm install
```

to install all dependencies.

## Usage

To start a simple web server with hot reload, enter

```console
npm start
```

Next, visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view the outcome (I've added a horizontal bar chart for testing).

In `index.ts`, the function `createChart` is called when the document is loaded. This is where you can toy around with your D3 code.
